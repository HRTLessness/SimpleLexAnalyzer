Summary: Lines, Total Tokens, Identifiers, Numbers, Booleans, Strings

Output:
-v flag => List tokens, Summary info
No flags => Summary Info
-idents flag => prints unique identifiers in alphabetical order
-nconst => List unique Number constant in order
-bconst => list unique Boolean constants in order
-sconst => list string constants in alphabetical order


Methods:
operator<< => print out the string value of Tokens, if it is (IDENT, ICONST, RCONST, SCONST, or BCONST) 
            it will print out the token along with the lexeme
id_or_kw() => searches for the lexeme in a map returns its corresponding token, or IDENT otherwise.
getNextToken()


Slide Notes:
For multi-character tokens, such as IDENT, ICONST, RCONST, and 
SCONST, create a state for each type of token, for example INID for
recognizing identifiers (IDENT), ININT for recognizing integer
constants (ICONST), and INSTRING for recognizing string literals
(SCONST) .
Transition from one state to another state is possible. For example from
the state of recognizing ICONST to the state of recognizing RCONST.
